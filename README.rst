Buildout for mote.voteit.se
===========================

This is the buildout for the production server on mote.voteit.se
We're using an Nginx server as a reverse proxy (and possibly load balancer)
in front of it.

You're of course free to copy and adapt this version.
Any contribution or suggestions is of course encouraged - and appreciated!
